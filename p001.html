            <h1 class="p-main-title">About the blog</h1>
            <p>Now, let's answer some questions.</p>
            <h2>So, what's this blog about?</h2>
            <p>I'm not entirely sure what exactly it's about, but it will definitely be about a lot of stuff.</p>
            <h2>Can you clarify what this 'stuff' is?</h2>
            <p>Well, it'll basically be about my thoughts, questions I have, random ideas that pop into my head and similar stuff.</p>
            <p>I may write about how I devour chocolate in one post and question the entire human race in the next. Or maybe I'll go in-depth about the intriguing life of immortal jellyfish and discuss how constantly shutting yourself in can be detrimental in the long run.</p>
            <h2>Now that's variety. Who are you anyway?</h2>
            <p>Moi? one of you of course, an individual human being to be more specific.</p>
            <h2>Why are there so many pages? Why not just have posts?</h2>
            <p>I'm trying to organize a few things here.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Posts are for general purposes.</li>
                    <li>Questions are about what I'm curious about and want to understand more of.</li>
                    <li>Notes are what I jot down when I learn things.</li>
                    <li>Musings are the insights I stumble upon - often inspired by something or someone.</li>
                </ul>
            <h2>So, why do you do all this?</h2>
            <p>I'm trying to make sense of what goes inside my head and as I'm quite fond of writing, I thought starting a blog would be a good idea.</p>
            <p>I could do this without publishing them in some quiet corner of the internet, yes, but if something I write would help someone else make sense of things on their own, wouldn't that be great?</p>
            <h2>That makes sense. That's it then?</h2>
            <p>For now, yes.</p>
