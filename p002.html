            <h1 class="p-main-title">Why cycles repeat and seem to never end</h1>
            <p class="credits">Inspired by: Inertia</p>
<p>When you are sitting still on a moving train (a very smooth ride),<br>
you too are moving along with the train, aren’t you?</p>
<p >Now imagine you’re a small particle fixed on a spot on a circle that is constantly moving.<br>
how would it feel for you?<br>
at rest of course, after all, you’re a small particle doing nothing.<br>
but does it mean you’re not moving?<br>
even though you won’t feel like it, the circle will keep moving and so will you, which means you get a ride without doing anything.<br>
That’s what being on a cycle feels like.</p>
<p>When you’re riding a bicycle, it doesn’t stop on its own, does it? you need to apply brakes for that.<br>
Why?<br>
Because the moving bicycle likes to keep moving. it dreads being still.<br>
Similarly, the bicycles which are not moving don’t like the idea of moving at all,<br>
which is why we need to exert some amount of force to start it moving,<br>
but once it starts, it again likes to keep moving more and more, and dreads being still the same.<br>
So, how do we stop a moving one?<br>
To do that, you need to exert enough force to overcome whatever that prevents it from stopping.<br>
Now if you ask why the moving things like to keep moving and dreads stopping and why stationary things dread moving and likes being still, you will notice that both of them like the state they’re already in.<br>
Moving bicycles likes to keep moving<br>
and the stationary one likes being still.<br>
Now why does this happen?<br>
it’s because they like to do what’s most natural for them, in other words, what requires the least amount of energy; be it being still or moving.</p>
<p>Why I used bicycles is mainly because it has the one word I want to talk more of today.<br>
the ‘cycles’</p>
<p>Now enough of the bicycles.<br>
Let’s focus on a cycle that won’t be obvious but simple.</p>
<p>Which hand did you use to brush your teeth today?<br>
Which hand did you use to shut the bathroom door?<br>
Which hand did you use to hold your coffee?<br>
It’s the same one you’ve always used, right?</p>
<p>Now why it is the same hand not the other is simple.<br>
You didn’t choose which hand to use, you just did.<br>
You didn’t wake up and made a mental note first thing in the morning saying 'today I’ll use my left/right hand, whichever that’s not dominant to brush my teeth’ now, did you?<br>
[well, if you do, this post is clearly not for you.]</p>
<p>We do them without thinking, we do them how we’ve always used to do them.<br>
There is nothing wrong with using the familiar hand to do all these things.<br>
Because these cycles are harmless, they’re often helpful to us overall since they leave space for us to think about other important things.</p>
<p>But then there are the cycles that aren’t quite harmless.<br>
Consider a bit more complex cycles too.<br>
Addiction; be it porn, social media or anything else.<br>
Once you get started, what you should watch next is already decided.<br>
Rather than giving you the chance to decide for yourself, they’ve made their suggestions make you feel like the only option you have, and you fall right into it, why? because it’s easy.</p>
<p>By now, it should be clear how we do things directly relate to what’s already familiar to us, what requires the least energy.<br>
The same happens with all cycles, including the not-so-good ones.</p>
<p>When we do things, whether our choices are good or bad for us isn’t really considered, instead we do what’s easiest.</p>
<p>If you love chocolate and eat as much as you’d like, next time you’re offered, it’s very unlikely that you’ll say no.<br>
if you scroll whenever what needs to be done is unclear, when relationships are in chaos or you don’t understand a subject topic you’re learning, you’ll scroll some more.<br>
if you lose sleep to account for all the hours you wasted, when an urgent assignment comes near the deadline, you will probably lose some more sleep.<br>
and if you consume an unhealthy amount of coffee to stay awake even if you’re dozing off and very much want to sleep, it’s very likely that you’ll have another.<br>
These are very personal, so anyone who says<br>
I mean chocolate is just so tasty and how could anyone hate it?<br>
I hate being confused, we need to avoid feeling that, shouldn’t we?<br>
losing sleep for a few hours is worthy to account for all the hours I wasted today, surely it can’t be that terrible for me, right?<br>
Coffee is divine, how could anyone deny one more (or a thousand more)?</p>
<p>I know right.</p>
<p>But you know what else is right?<br>
what’s easiest for us isn’t always what’s healthiest for us.<br>
Our next action may feel like the best thing to do even when it really is the worst. All because of what?<br>
Familiarity.</p>
<p>Every single thing in our day is a part of cycle, they won’t be obvious of course, but it doesn’t change the fact they are.<br>
Some are good for us; some are bad but what’s common is that<br>
they’re all familiar.</p>
<p>So, first of all, we have to be able to judge everything that we’re familiar to.<br>
Now on what aspect are you going to judge these?<br>
To get an answer to that, consider these instances.</p>
<p>Eating chocolate a few times a week — eating about a kilo each day<br>
Distracting yourself to avoid being confused for a while ---- in the continued act, never trying to make what’s confused clear.<br>
Losing sleep for a few hours on one day ---- doing the same in all exam seasons.<br>
Drinking coffee to keep yourself awake in that one sleep depriving night — doing it frequently.</p>
<p>Simply, doing a thing for once is different from doing it always.<br>
Now, think about these instances and try to find a pattern.<br>
The former will be good in the short term and won’t affect the long term much but the latter, it will make you feel like your short term is heaven while all your long-term is a hell in its construction.</p>
<p>How you judge all that are familiar should always be concerning their long-term effects<br>
because consuming unhealthy amounts of caffeine and depriving yourself of sleep are linked to having serious health issues, and distracting yourself from the problem doesn’t solve your problem.</p>
<p>If you are on a moving bicycle,<br>
you can stop it,<br>
you only need to apply brakes-<br>
If you want to get your bicycle moving,<br>
you can get it moving,<br>
you only need to push the paddles.<br>
Both actions do require energy<br>
and it will need some more<br>
until it becomes the easiest to do next.</p>
<p>Cycles tend too repeat, be it how you brush your teeth or your choice of digital feed.<br>
All that matters is whether you’re willing to exert some energy to do what needs to be done and continue doing it until it becomes familiar.<br>
Remember we love what’s familiar but what’s familiar isn’t always what’s healthiest for us.<br>
Above all, you need to believe that unhealthy cycles can be stopped and healthy ones can be started.</p>
